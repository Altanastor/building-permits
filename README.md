# building-permits

This repository provies the code and data accompanying my "[whole game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go5Au01Jrvs)" intro to data science video. The goal of this video is to quickly outline all the parts of a data science project so you get an overview of how everything hangs together, and see a little bit of my workflow.

* [permits-actual.md](permits-actual.md): this is the actual code I typed
  during the video

* [permits-practice.md](permits-practice.md): practice code that I wrote
  beforehand. The code is a little nicer and it has more comments.

## TODO

* Figure out how to show keyboard shortcuts on screen
