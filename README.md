# building-permits

This repository provies the code and data accompanying my "whole game" intro to data science video.

* [permits-actual.md](permits-actual.md): this is the actual code I typed
  during the video

* [permits-practice.md](permits-practice.md): practice code that I wrote
  beforehand
